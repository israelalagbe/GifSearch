Riby Angular Frontend exercise
===============================


Setup
-----

- npm install
- ng serve --open
- npm test

Tasks
-----

1. Implement a simple .gif search App based on the Giphy API.
- after entering a search term into the text input and clicking on the search button the app should query the Giphy API and display related .gifs below the text input.
- onclick of any of the gif, it should go to another page showing the details of the gif
- The [url] is an example of how to access the API and an API key you can use.

2. write unit tests for the search field and the results list

3. add mechanics to make all results of the giphy search available to the user


Expectations
------------
- delivery is about 60 minutes after start
- You must implement state management of the app using redux 
- you are free to choose whatever approach you like, but there should be obvious reasons
